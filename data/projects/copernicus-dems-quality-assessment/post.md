Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are 3D representations of the terrain or surface of the Earth. These models consist of elevations on a discrete grid, usually stored in standard or custom image formats. DEMs may represent a city, a region, a country or even the whole world.

This study aimed to assess the quality of the three Copernicus Digital Elevation Models. Copernicus DEM GLO-90 and GLO-30 are two global models, whereas EEA-10 only covers Europe. In these studies, the heights of Copernicus DEMs are compared to hundreds of millions of reference elevations from the ICESat-1, ICESat-2 and GEDI acquisitions. The study highlights the great accuracy of the three Copernicus DEMs, especially compared to other global DEMs.

# My contribution

I carried-out this study, developed the tools required to process DEMs, reference altimetry data and to perform statistical analysis. I also edited the entire technical note giving the methods and results of this study. All the processes have been developed in Java, using a multithreaded approach.
