Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are 3D representations of the terrain or surface of the Earth. These models consist of elevations on a discrete grid, usually stored in standard or custom image formats. DEMs may represent a city, a region, a country or even the whole world.

One typical use of the Digital Elevation Models is the terrain correction of radar data, such as Sentinel-1 scenes. As Sentinel-1 does not acquire data vertically, topography is visible in the resulting radar images. Using DEMs, it is possible to alleviate this effect, retrieving more homogeneous radar scenes. The study shows that the native resolution of the DEM has an important impact on the quality of the correction.
