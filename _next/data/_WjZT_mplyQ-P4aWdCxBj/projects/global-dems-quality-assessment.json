These models consist of elevations on a discrete grid, usually stored in standard or custom image formats. DEMs may represent a city, a region, a country or even the whole world. Nowadays, a wide variety of DEMs are free to download and use.\n\nThe \"Global DEMs quality assessment\" study aims to find the best open global DEMs. Three global DEMs have been compared in this study: ALOS World 3D, ASTER GDEM and SRTM. Heights of these DEMs are compared to precise elevations obtained from the ICESat-1 mission, considered as the altimetric reference. All the ICESat-1 heights have been considered, resulting in tens of millions of height comparisons. The overall statistics highlight the superiority of ALOS World 3D, which has shown the lowest elevation differences with ICESat-1 data.\n\n# My contribution\n\nI carried-out this study, developed the tools required to process DEMs, reference altimetry data and to perform statistical analysis. I also edited the entire technical note giving the methods and results of this study. All the processes have been developed in Java, using a multithreaded approach."},"__N_SSG":true}
