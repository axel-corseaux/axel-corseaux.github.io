These models consist of elevations on a discrete grid, usually stored in standard or custom image formats. DEMs may represent a city, a region, a country or even the whole world.\n\nThis notebook aims to give researchers a user-friendly tool to retrieve DEM layers (heights and ancillary data) and run tests on user defined areas. Given this notebook and a Jupyter environment, users may run cells to get through different examples of DEM processings and visualisations. The DEMIX lib, which is part of the notebook, is used to send DEM processing requests to the VisioTerra servers. Depending on the request, the returned entity may be in json or GeoTIFF format, and contain DEM heights or results of tests.\n\n# My contribution\n\nI implemented the back-end of this solution in Java J2EE using servlets. The server side is responsible for processing DEM data and tests. I also developed the last cell of the notebook, which was a first user interface for retrieving DEM data without any code required from the user side. This interface has been superseded by the DEMIX Operations Platform, which is a standalone interface written in Javascript.\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
