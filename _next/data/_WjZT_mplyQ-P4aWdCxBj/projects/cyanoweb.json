These bacteria may be found in a lot of terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and are particularly known for their blue-green color. In water habitats, such as lakes, high concentrations of cyanobacteria can be harmful for humans. Fortunately, a high concentration of these bacteria results in a change of water color.\n\nThe CyanoWeb platform uses Sentinel-2 data to track changes of color in monitored lakes. This service automatically processes the most recent Sentinel-2 acquisitions to estimate a concentration of cyanobacteria. Users registered as operators may send an alert when the concentration is deemed too high for swimming.\n\n# My contribution\n\nI developed both the front-end and back-end of this solution. This platform relies on a study of correlation between the color of lakes and the concentration of cyanobacteria, which has been performed by one of my colleagues. The back-end is made using Java J2EE servlets, and JavaMail for sending alerts of high cyanobacteria concentrations. The front-end is in pure HTML, CSS and Javascript."},"__N_SSG":true}
